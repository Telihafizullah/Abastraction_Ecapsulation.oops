    "# Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example. \n",
    "#  Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the process of hiding a program's underlying implementation and details. \n",
    "# It's a core concept that simplifies things by focusing on relevant features and hiding unnecessary ones.\n",
    "#  Abstraction can help manage complexity by splitting it up into smaller parts\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example. \n",
    "#  \n",
    "# Abstraction and Encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "#  While they are often mentioned together, they serve different purposes: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#Abastraction\n",
    "# Focus:\n",
    "# Hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
    "# Goal:\n",
    "# Simplify interaction with complex systems by focusing on what an object does, not how it does it.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Consider a car. You interact with the steering wheel, pedals, and gear lever to drive it. \n",
    "# You don't need to know about the engine, transmission, or electronics that make it work. \n",
    "\n",
    "#Encapculation\n",
    "# Focus: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class.\n",
    "# Goal: Protect the internal state of an object and control access to it.\n",
    "# Example: In a car, the engine is encapsulated under the hood. You can't directly access or modify its parts.\n",
    "# You interact with the car through its controlled interface (steering wheel, pedals, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "# The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes\". It provides a way to define interfaces (contracts) that classes must adhere to. \n",
    "# This ensures consistency and structure in your code, especially when working with inheritance and polymorphism   \n",
    "# By defining abstract methods in an abstract base class, you ensure that all subclasses implement those methods.\n",
    "# This helps in creating a consistent interface across different classes and makes your code more robust and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?   \n",
    "# Abstract Classes:\n",
    "# These are classes that cannot be instantiated directly. They serve as blueprints for other classes, defining a common interface\n",
    "# that derived classes must implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstract Methods:\n",
    "# These are methods declared in an abstract class but without any implementation. Subclasses are required to provide concrete implementations\n",
    "#  for these methods\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. Can we create an instance of an abstract class? Explain your answer. \n",
    "# No, we cannot create an instance of an abstract class in Python\n",
    "#Purpose of Abstract Classes:\n",
    "# Abstract classes\n",
    "# are meant to serve as blueprints or templates for other classes. They define a common interface that their subclasses must implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Incomplete Implementation:\n",
    "# Abstract classes can contain abstract methods, which are declared but not implemented. This means they lack complete functionality and cannot be \n",
    "# used directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# TypeError on Instantiation:\n",
    "# Attempting to create an instance of an abstract class will raise a TypeError.\n",
